# 🚨 NATIVE ALARM MEDICINE SCHEDULING FIX

## Problem Identified
User reported: "Alarm is working fine but all this is working only for TEST NATIVE ALARM (10 seconds) option in settings. But not working for medicines that requires to trigger a native alarm."

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `scheduleLocalNotification` function logic:

1. **Test Native Alarm worked** because it scheduled a single alarm for a specific time (10 seconds from now)
2. **Medicine Native Alarms failed** because:
   - The scheduling logic was inside the daily loop (for 7 days) 
   - Native alarm scheduling was called once per day in the loop
   - Each call would overwrite the previous alarm instead of creating multiple alarms
   - The logic used `continue` to skip the rest of the loop, preventing proper recurring setup

## Technical Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced `scheduleNativeAlarm` Function
```javascript
const scheduleNativeAlarm = async (medicine, scheduleForDays = 7) => {
  // Now handles multiple days scheduling internally
  for (let day = 0; day < scheduleForDays; day++) {
    const alarmTime = new Date(now);
    alarmTime.setDate(alarmTime.getDate() + day);
    alarmTime.setHours(parseInt(hours), parseInt(minutes), 0, 0);
    
    // Unique alarm ID per day to prevent overwrites
    const alarmId = (parseInt(medicine.id) % 10000) + (day * 10000);
    
    await window.Capacitor.Plugins.MedicineAlarm.scheduleAlarm({
      medicineName: medicine.name,
      dosage: `${medicine.dosage} ${medicine.dosageType}`,
      patientName: medicine.patientName || '',
      triggerTime: triggerTime,
      alarmId: alarmId
    });
  }
}
```

### 2. Fixed `scheduleLocalNotification` Logic
```javascript
// Handle native alarms FIRST (outside the daily loop)
if (medicine.alertType === 'native-alarm') {
  console.log('🔊 Scheduling NATIVE ALARM for', medicine.name);
  try {
    await scheduleNativeAlarm(medicine); // Schedules for 7 days internally
    console.log('✅ Native alarm scheduled successfully - skipping Capacitor notifications');
    return; // Exit early for native alarms
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to schedule native alarm, falling back to Capacitor alarm:', error);
    // Continue with Capacitor notifications as fallback
    medicine.alertType = 'alarm';
  }
}

// Then handle regular Capacitor notifications (for non-native alarms)
for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
  // Regular notification scheduling logic...
}
```

### 3. Updated `cancelNativeAlarm` Function
```javascript
const cancelNativeAlarm = async (medicineId) => {
  // Cancel alarms for all 7 days
  for (let day = 0; day < 7; day++) {
    const alarmId = (parseInt(medicineId) % 10000) + (day * 10000);
    await window.Capacitor.Plugins.MedicineAlarm.cancelAlarm({ alarmId: alarmId });
  }
}
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Moved native alarm handling outside the daily loop** - Native alarms are now scheduled once for multiple days instead of being called repeatedly in a loop

2. **Enhanced alarm ID generation** - Each day gets a unique alarm ID to prevent overwrites:
   - Day 0: `medicineId + 0`
   - Day 1: `medicineId + 10000`  
   - Day 2: `medicineId + 20000`
   - etc.

3. **Proper error handling and fallback** - If native alarm fails, it falls back to regular Capacitor alarms

4. **Early return for native alarms** - Once native alarms are scheduled, the function returns early to avoid scheduling duplicate Capacitor notifications

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ For Medicine with "Native Alarm" Type:
1. User creates medicine with `alertType: 'native-alarm'`
2. `scheduleLocalNotification()` calls `scheduleNativeAlarm(medicine)`
3. `scheduleNativeAlarm()` schedules 7 separate Android alarms (one for each day)
4. Each alarm has unique ID to prevent conflicts
5. At scheduled time, Android AlarmManager triggers the alarm
6. AlarmService launches AlarmActivity with dismiss/snooze buttons
7. User can interact with full-screen alarm interface

### ✅ For Test Native Alarm:
- Still works as before (single alarm for immediate testing)

## Files Modified
- `src/MedicineReminderApp.jsx` - Fixed native alarm scheduling logic
- Build system updated with `npm run build` and `npx cap sync android`
- Android APK rebuilt: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Testing Instructions
1. Install the updated APK on your Android device
2. Create a new medicine with "Native Alarm" alert type
3. Set time for 2-3 minutes in the future
4. Save the medicine
5. Wait for the scheduled time
6. Verify that:
   - Device wakes up and shows full-screen red alarm interface
   - Medicine name, dosage, and patient info are displayed
   - DISMISS and SNOOZE buttons work properly
   - Alarm sound plays and device vibrates

## Technical Notes
- Native alarms now properly handle recurring daily schedules
- Each medicine can have up to 7 pending native alarms (one per day)
- Alarm IDs are carefully managed to prevent conflicts between medicines
- Fallback to Capacitor notifications if native alarms fail
- Compatible with existing AlarmActivity.java and AlarmService.java

The fix ensures that medicine scheduling with native alarms now works identically to the test alarm functionality, providing reliable wake-up alarms for medication reminders.
