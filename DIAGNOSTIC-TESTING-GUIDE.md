## 🩺 ENHANCED ALARM DIAGNOSTICS - TESTING GUIDE

The app now includes comprehensive diagnostics to identify why alarms aren't working. Follow these steps:

### 📱 INSTALL UPDATED APP:
1. Copy the APK from: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
2. Install on your Android device
3. Grant ALL permissions when prompted

### 🔧 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TO RUN:

#### 1. **🔌 Test Native Plugin Connection** (NEW!)
- This is the **MOST IMPORTANT** test
- Click this button FIRST
- It will tell you if the native alarm system is properly connected
- If it shows "NOT CONNECTED" - the native alarms will never work

#### 2. **🩺 Run Complete Diagnostic**
- Provides comprehensive report on:
  - Plugin connection status
  - Android permissions
  - Device info
  - Pending notifications
  - Critical Android settings to check

#### 3. **🚨🔊 TEST NATIVE ALARM (10 seconds)**
- Tests the actual alarm sound
- Should wake device and play loud alarm
- Uses real Android AlarmManager

### 📊 WHAT THE DIAGNOSTICS WILL TELL YOU:

#### ✅ **If Plugin Connected:**
- Shows Android API version
- Shows if "Alarms & reminders" permission is needed
- Shows if permission is granted
- Provides specific steps to fix permission issues

#### ❌ **If Plugin NOT Connected:**
- Means native alarms cannot work
- Indicates MainActivity.java registration issue
- Requires app rebuild/reinstall

### 🚨 CRITICAL ANDROID SETTINGS TO CHECK:

1. **Settings → Apps → MyMedAlert → Notifications**
   - Enable ALL notification types

2. **Settings → Apps → Special access → Alarms & reminders**
   - Find MyMedAlert and ENABLE

3. **Settings → Apps → MyMedAlert → Battery**
   - Set to "Not optimized"

4. **Settings → Sound → Do Not Disturb**
   - Allow MyMedAlert to interrupt

### 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW:

1. Run "🔌 Test Native Plugin Connection" first
2. If plugin not connected → Uninstall/reinstall app
3. If plugin connected but no permission → Follow permission steps
4. If all looks good → Test with "🚨🔊 TEST NATIVE ALARM"
5. Create test medicine with "Native Alarm" type
6. Set alert time 1-2 minutes in future
7. Check if alarm actually triggers

### 📞 NEXT STEPS:
After testing, let me know:
- What the "Native Plugin Connection" test shows
- What the "Complete Diagnostic" reports
- Whether the "TEST NATIVE ALARM" works
- If you can hear the alarm sound and feel vibration

The enhanced diagnostics will pinpoint exactly what's preventing the alarms from working!
